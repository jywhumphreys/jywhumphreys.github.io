        <div class="subheader-text">Project Details / Background</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international robotics competition in which teams of high-school students are given 6 weeks to design, build, and program a functional robot which is able to fulfill the unique and complex challenges specific to that year's game. In addition to the technical aspects, teams must also engage in fundraising, develop a team brand, and participate in STEM outreach within their community.</div>
          <div class="body-text">As a founding member of our area's first and only student-run community robotics team, I played a key role in establishing the team, forming relationships with local businesses and corporations to secure sponsorships, grants, and manufacturing resources. As electronics lead, I designed and wired reliable electrical systems for over 10 robots, achieving a 0% electrical failure rate for four consecutive years, and at competitions, I was a member of the "pit crew", a group of 5 people responsible for maintaining and repairing the robot.</div>

      <!-- ADDITIONAL DETAILS -->
      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">My Role and Achievements</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">As the electronics lead from August 2018 to July 2022, one of my primary responsibilities was ensuring that our robot was operational and ready to compete in every match. To achieve this, I focused on designing a reliable and robust electrical system that could be quickly and easily diagnosed.</div>
          <div class="body-text">By strategically mounting all of the electronic components on the bottom of the robot, I created a system that was highly accessible, allowing for rapid maintenance and repairs without the need to navigate through or around complex mechanisms. This approach not only improved the robot's reliability but also resulted in a cleaner and more organized wiring layout.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Key achievements and innovations include:</div>
          <ul class="project-list">
            <li>Designed and implemented reliable and robust electrical systems for over 10 robots</li>
            <li>Achieved a 0% electrical failure rate in matches for four consecutive years</li>
            <li>Created a "flipped" electrical board design, allowing for easy component mounting and wire routing</li>
            <li>Implemented a CNC-routed diamond pattern on the electronics board for improved organization</li>
            <li>Served as a member of the 5-person "pit crew" responsible for robot maintenance and repairs during competitions</li>
          </ul>

      <!-- KEY TAKEAWAYS -->
      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="subheader-text">Key Takeaways</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">My experience with FIRST Robotics Team 7461 was instrumental in developing my skills in electrical engineering, project management, and teamwork. The challenges we faced in designing and building robots under tight time constraints taught me valuable lessons about efficient problem-solving and creative thinking.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Moreover, being part of a student-run team allowed me to develop leadership skills and gain experience in managing resources, both human and material. The success we achieved, particularly in maintaining a perfect record of electrical reliability, demonstrated the importance of meticulous planning and execution in engineering projects.</div>
